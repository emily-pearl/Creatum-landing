             <!-- TODO: Add expand/collapse functionality for answers using JavaScript -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How fast can I start seeing results?</h3>
                <p>Many clients see initial process improvements and time savings within the first few weeks of deploying ClAIrity agents. Our AI Opportunity Diagnosis session is designed to identify quick wins, ensuring you experience immediate impact and a rapid return on investment.</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need to replace my procurement software?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely not! ClAIrity is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing procurement systems (like SAP, Coupa, etc.). Think of it as an intelligent layer that enhances your current tools, automating tasks and providing insights without requiring a disruptive rip-and-replace.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is my company too small for AI agents?</h3>
                <p>Not at all! ClAIrity is built to scale. Whether you're a large enterprise or a growing mid-sized company, our AI agents can deliver significant value. Smaller teams often benefit the most by automating repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on strategic activities that drive growth.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is my data safe with CREATUM and clAIrity?</h3>
                <p>Data security is our top priority. ClAIrity operates with enterprise-grade security protocols, including encryption and strict access controls. We are fully GDPR compliant and ensure your sensitive procurement data is handled with the utmost confidentiality and integrity. We can discuss specific security requirements during the AI Opportunity Diagnosis.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How customizable is the clAIrity platform?</h3>
                <p>Highly customizable! While ClAIrity offers pre-built agent modules (SCOUT.AI, KONT.AI, TICKET.AI), we tailor the workflows, data integrations, and decision parameters to your specific procurement processes and business rules. Our goal is to fit ClAIrity to your needs, not the other way around.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I start small with one module and scale?</h3>
                <p>Yes, absolutely! ClAIrity is modular. You can start with the agent module that addresses your most pressing need (e.g., SCOUT.AI for supplier discovery) and add other modules like KONT.AI (contract analysis) or TICKET.AI (procurement support) as your needs evolve. This allows for a flexible, phased implementation that matches your budget and priorities.</p>
